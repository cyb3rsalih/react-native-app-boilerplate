# Getting started 
`cd projectFolder && npm install` 
 
## Build 
 
### Android 
 
`react-native run-android` 

I can't find a way for set an emulator for Android. 
 
 Firstly I open an emulator from Android Studio, then
run the command.
 
### iOS 
 
`react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 6"`  

If you don't specify a simulator, it will use iPhone X.
